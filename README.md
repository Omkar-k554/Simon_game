# Simon Game 
This is a Simon Game project that I built after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##  Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

##  About the Project
The Simon Game is a memory-based game where the player must repeat the pattern shown by the system. 
With each level, the pattern increases, making the game more challenging.

##  What I Learned
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Game logic implementation
- Basic project structure
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
  
##  How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Repeat the pattern shown.
3. The pattern grows every level.
4. If you press the wrong button, the game restarts.
